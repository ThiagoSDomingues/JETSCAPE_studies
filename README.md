JETSCAPE_studies Repository for studies using the JETSCAPE simulational framework.

This repository will be important to understand and calculate heavy-ion collisions observables.

The first study that I want to do is: 

* Study $v_0(p_T)$, the differential radial flow coefficient, in details.

I added ***preliminary*** notes about this new observable. Be careful! They are very preliminary and **I didn't add references**!
